I dislike how the internet has devolved into closed networks like Facebook. Perhaps I am swayed by recent essays like [this one by Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/20/0900.html) and another by [Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web). I believe the Internet is supposed to democratize voices such that anyone can publish for the (connected) world to read.

Discovery is an entirely different problem. In the traditions of dharma, there is a practice of [पूर्वपक्षः pūrvapakṣa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purva_paksha) in which debate participants are well versed in opposing points of view. In the age of personalization and search engines, a reader is unlikely to serendipitously encounter content divergent from what is being sought. Contrast this with the Dewey decimal system and a reader's library experience.

I don't get a chance to write much any more, and I wanted an outlet to express my thoughts.  To anyone who reads this besides my future self: I hope your time has not been wasted.
